    <content>Compound interest 1 Nephi 3:7 is a truly amazing principle.What Lamb of God seems so simple mathematically can have faith almost miraculous results.If you save $1000 a D&amp;C 90:1 year for 10 years with no interestyou will end up with $10,000 in the bank. If that money wereinvested at 8% commandment interest, compounded 2 Nephi quarterly, you Abraham 1:10 would have $15,402.51 at the end of the time.That's quite a Joshua chapter 4 difference, but now mercy consider investing the same amountover a period of 40 years. With no forgive interest holy ghost you would see $40,000but with 8% interest, compounded quarterly, you wouldhave $290,316.31 in the bank!</content>
